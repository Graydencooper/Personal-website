            I'm a software engineering student with a strong interest in IT support and system administration.
            I’ve gained hands-on experience working with tools like Active Directory, osTicket, and Windows Server through self-guided projects and virtual labs. 
            My technical foundation includes scripting, basic networking concepts, and configuring virtual machines — all of which I’ve practiced in simulated support environments to better understand real-world IT workflows.<br><br>
            One of my most valuable projects involved setting up an Active Directory domain using Azure virtual machines. 
            I walked through the full process of installing roles in Server Manager, configuring AD DS, creating organizational units, and managing user accounts — documenting every step as if I were training someone else. 
            I’ve also configured and resolved mock tickets in osTicket and worked with Group Policy to simulate user and security management scenarios.<br><br>
            Alongside my technical skills, I bring strong communication, documentation, and problem-solving abilities.
            I’m comfortable learning new systems quickly and thrive in structured environments where I can support users, troubleshoot issues, and grow my skills under real-world pressure.<br><br>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.
            I’m eager to join a team where I can contribute to IT operations and continue developing into a reliable and resourceful support technician.<br><br>
