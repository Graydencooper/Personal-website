                Dear Hiring Team,<br><br>
                I’m a software engineering student with a strong interest in roles where I can leverage my technical experience and fast learning ability to help drive revenue. While my background includes skills like scripting, web development, and systems configuration, I’m most energized by opportunities to apply that knowledge in a people-focused way — whether that’s through clear communication, problem-solving, or building trust with clients. I’m especially drawn to tech sales, customer success, and support roles where I can act as a bridge between technical solutions and the people who need them.
                <br><br>Throughout my education and work experience, I’ve developed a reputation for being a quick learner, an adaptable team player, and someone who takes initiative. From implementing account lockout policies in Windows Server to building and hosting my own portfolio site, I’ve enjoyed diving into complex tools and presenting them in a clear, structured way — a skill I believe is essential in any client-facing role.<br><br>
                I’m especially drawn to environments that value hard work, willingness to learn, and a growth mindset. I bring those qualities to everything I do, and I’m ready to apply them in a role where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to learn.
                <br><br>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. If my blend of technical aptitude and customer service could be a good fit for your team, I’d love to connect.
